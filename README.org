#+title: Implementing VPT2

Inspired by the paper "[[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.0c09526][How to VPT2]]" with some help from "[[https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Vibrations-Infrared-Vibrational-Chemistry/dp/048663941X][Molecular
Vibrations"]] and the [[https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects][Crawford Programming Projects]]

* TODOs
  - [ ] see [[pdf:/home/brent/Library/spectro.pdf:43][spectro manual]] about normal coordinates
    - trying to compute harmonic frequencies from the force constants
    - I think once you have them in normal coordinates you can just
      diagonalize
  - [ ] anharmonic frequencies
